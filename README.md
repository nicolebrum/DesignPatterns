# DesignPatterns - GoF patterns with examples

I am currently studying design patterns in order to improve my code architecture knowledge. This repository contains code examples for the patterns I'm studying, which are all GoF patterns.

The core idea of creating a repository for these examples is providing different examples for the same patterns, categorizing examples in "difficulty levels". Each folder represents a pattern, containing one subfolder for each difficulty level.
