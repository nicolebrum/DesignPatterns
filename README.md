# DesignPatterns - GoF patterns with examples

I am currently studying design patterns in order to improve my code architecture knowledge. This repository contains code examples for the patterns I'm studying, which are all GoF patterns.

The core idea of creating a repository for this is providing different examples for the same patterns, categorizing examples in "difficulty levels". Each folder represents a pattern, containing one subfolder for each difficulty level. Difficulty levels follow a guideline:


- Level 0: raw examples. This serves as a basic PoC for each pattern. Level 0 examples won't use variables mocking any particular situation or real word entity
- Level 1: examples that try to mock real world entities, but no intending to be real world examples
- Level 2: examples that try to mock real world implementations
